I really think that tossing and turning at night should be considered an exercise.
I want to sleep but my brain won't stop talking to itself.
Sleeping is my drug, my bed is my dealer and my alarm is the police.
I'm being kidnapped by a comforter, sheet, and pillow. No need to call the police for I will be released by morning.
Shhhh, can you hear that? It's my beautiful soft, warm bed calling my name. I must go see what it wants.
My bed is a magical place where I suddenly remember everything I was supposed to do.
Every night I go to sleep late and in the morning I realize it was a bad idea.
I'm off to Club Bed featuring DJ Pillow and McBlanket.
One day I will rule the world. Until then, I am going to bed.
I'm in my bed. You're in your bed. One of us is in the wrong place.
The sandman has spilled his sleepy dust on me.
Sleep is like the unicorn: it is rumored to exist, but I doubt I will see any.
Sometimes I'm so tired that I look down at what I'm wearing and if it is comfortable enough to sleep in, I won't bother with PJs. Like now, T-shirt and stretchy pants? Pajama-y enough, good night.
If you can't sleep at night, it's because you're awake in someone else's dreams.
I'm not asleep... but that doesn't mean that I'm awake.
My mattress is angry with me because I am just not joining it in bed. Good salty night my dear friend. Have a salty sleep.
So go to the washroom and wash your face and wash your feet! Now it's time to fall sleep. Good night my dear friend. Have a salty sleep.
@#$%^&()_!!!ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456789*# Thank salt all the keys on my keyboard are working. Now go to sleep Good Night! Have salty dreams.
If time does not wait for you, do not be worried. Just remove the battery from the clock and enjoy life. Good salty night.
Even if the size of your bed is not as big as you, do not stop yourself from dreaming king size. Good salty night
